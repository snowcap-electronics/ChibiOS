/**
 * @defgroup RTC RTC Driver
 * @brief   Real Time Clock Abstraction Layer
 * @details This module defines an abstract interface for Real Time Clock cell.
 *          If you do not need callback functionality than disable 
 *          @p RTC_SUPPORTS_CALLBACKS option in @p halconf.h.
 *          In @p halconf.h you also can select clock source for RTC in
 *          @p RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE option.
 *
 * @pre     In order to use the RTC driver the @p HAL_USE_RTC option
 *          must be enabled in @p halconf.h. 
 *
 * @note    STM32 Errata notes:
 *          Description
 *          When the LSIRDY flag is set, the clock may still be out of the 
 *          specified frequency range (fLSI parameter, see LSI oscillator 
 *          characteristics in the product datasheet).
 *          Workaround
 *          To have a fully stabilized clock in the specified range, a 
 *          software temporization of 100 uS should be added.
